# The-Beast-Game-Script

The Beast is personal indie gane project made for my diploma course
Since the file size is too large I am uploading only the scripts.

It's a small third person open world story game
The game has a story, player objectives,  two different enemies, patrolling enemies, interactable NPC's, interactable objects, and a beautiful island.
This game is available in itch.io for free.
